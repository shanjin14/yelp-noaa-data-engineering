    "\n",
    "#### Scope \n",
    "In this capstone project, we will be ingesting the yelp review dataset and NOAA weather dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### End Solution Overview\n",
    "The project will follow a two-tier data platform architecture. s3 is used as the Data Lake, Redshift is the Data Warehouse.\n",
    "Data are landed in the raw bucket in s3 and get through transformation and landed as a staging table in Redshift.\n",
    "The data is further transformed into the dimensional model as a foundation data tables\n",
    "<img src=\"DataPlatformArchitecture.PNG\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefit of such design is that if we have additional functional area need the same set of data with different dimensional model.\n",
    "We can easily build a separate set of Airflow DAG to address their need without re-loading the data in staging.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tools\n",
    "1. Data Lake - s3\n",
    "2. Data Warehouse - Redshift\n",
    "3. ETL Orchestration - Airflow\n",
    "4. ETL processing - EMR (PySpark)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Describe and Gather Data \n",
    "##### 2 data sources:\n",
    "1. NOAA temperature data using NOAA web services API \n",
    "   Constantly extract and load to the datawarehouse\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Yelp Dataset: The dataset is a sample dataset\n",
    "    However, it can be extended to continuous load if anyone aquire the license from Yelp.\n",
    "    From their developer site, this is something they offered \n",
    "    https://www.yelp.com/developers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective of the dataset\n",
    "1. Explore what are the possible popular location\n",
    "2. What is the effect of weather to the footfall?\n",
    "3. Competition within localitiy location?\n",
    "4. Customer review on the restaurant location"

    "### Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data\n",
    "#### Data overview\n",
    "THe two selected data sources are using json format and API. Both of them have pre-defined schema hence we do not have change of column name so that we can relies on the column name(or key) to do the data processing and load.\n",
    "The key challenge and issue of the two data sources are listed below\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Yelp Dataset \n",
    "##### Data Issue/Challenge #1 - non-atomic value\n",
    "For example in the checkin.json, for each row of business_id, it consist of all the date that users check in single row and it quickly reach the maximum number of character that can be store in redshift in single cell( 65536 characters). In order for it be loaded to redshift, we need to transform the data to row level, which each row has one checkin date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Same issue can be found in users.json, which the friends column consist of all the user's friends user_id and it exceeds the maximum varchar character limit from redshift\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve the issue, we use pyspark to do a transformation before load the data to redshift\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data Issue/Challenge #2 timestamp format\n",
    "To ensure the timestamp is correctly parsed into the redshift, as part of pyspark ETL, we parse the timestamp to time stamp data type before load to redshift\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NOAA Weather data\n",
    "##### Data Issue/Challenge #1 - multiple endpoint\n",
    "NOAA has very rich API services. However, the data are located in different endpoints. In order to combine the data into the meaning structure to load to redshift. A python script is written to handle the combination of multiple API endpoints output into single dataframe, create a csv and upload it to s3\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data Issue/Challenge #2 - missing data\n",
    "NOAA has missing data for some station ID. Error handling is added to exclude those missing data\n"

    "##### Rationale\n",
    "The project has used a combination of ELT +ETL\n",
    "1. If the data can be loaded directly to redshift, we follow the \"ELT\" approach and load it to staging table in redshift and subequently \"T\"ransform them into the designated dimensional model\n",
    "2. If the data cannot be loaded directly, we will first \"T\"ransform the data and load them to staging table and subsquently move them into the dimensional model\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data nature, we have adopted below technologies:\n",
    "1. Pyspark with EMR cluster : it is used for ETL process. We also used pyspark notebook to explore the dataset as the yelp data is too big to be loaded to single laptop for EDA\n",
    "2. Redshift                 : it is used as the data warehouse(sink) for the staging layer and foundation layer\n",
    "3. Airflow                  : It is used for orchestrating the entire ETL/ELT pipeline. It also handle the incremental load and backfill"

    "2. NOAA data - It is designed as daily load job. The pipeline will do incremental load and backfill the past 3 days data in case the pipeline break in any day and still can be recovered in the next day"

    "##### Scenario planning\n",
    "###### 1. The data was increased by 100x.\n",
    "1. Re-assess the redshift data space and whether we need to scale-up the redshift nodes to have more nodes (and hence more data space)\n",
    "2. Re-assess the airflow timeout parameter and data partitioning:\n",
    "    - We have incorporated timeout parameter to prevent pipeline run indefintely and block the thread. This would need to be re-assessed if need to be changes\n",
    "    - The data is partitioned by day now. However,if the data is 100x more, we might need to change it to hourly job\n",
    "\n",
    "###### 2. The data populates a dashboard that must be updated on a daily basis by 7am every day.\n",
    "1. We would need to schedule a pipeline to run daily before midnight\n",
    "2. Another key consideration is how many day lag allowed by the dashboard. If the user allow the dashboard to have data cutoff at T-2 date. We can incorporate quality checks to ensure the data shown are accurate before it is seen in T date.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### 3. The database needed to be accessed by 100+ people.\n",
    "1. Re-assess the number of nodes available in redshift and if we need to scale it up to handle the load\n",
